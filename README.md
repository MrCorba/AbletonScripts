# AbletonScripts

This project tries to create a big modular script connection to the Ableton Live API. The goal is to make the API usable to everyone without knowledge of the API or Python.

*Note 1*

For the moment this script is developed for Ableton Live 9, so compatibility for older or newer versions is **not** guaranteed. If anyone wants to check and create this compatibility, let me know!

*Note 2*

This script is tested with the Lemur iPad app. If anyone has wishes for special versions, let me know!
